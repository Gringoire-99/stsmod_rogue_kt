Introduction(gen by ai)
This mod introduces a playable character, the Rogue from Hearthstone, featuring 84 brand new cards and 9 derivative
cards. Currently, the mod supports Simplified Chinese and English.
Most card images are sourced from the Hearthstone Wiki and AI-generated images. A small portion of images are taken from
the web and the Slay the Spire open-source project (will remove if infringement).

Mechanics and Features
Mechanic: Weapons
"Always have a blade at the ready."
Equip yourself with a weapon using Weapon cards or your hero power! Weapons have their own attack power and durability,
providing you with additional attack opportunities. Enhance your weapon and weaken your enemies with various poison
cards! Some weapons have unique attack effects that grant you special bonuses.

Mechanic: Combo
"Smooth moves, powerful results!"
Combo cards often have powerful extra effects, but to activate a Combo, you must first play other cards.

Mechanic: Plagiarism
"Steal and make it your own, clever victory!"
Discover cards from other classes and put them to use!

Mechanic: Hero
"Wicked Knife (Category: Trash)"
After playing a Hero card, your basic hero power will be replaced with a powerful upgraded power!

Mechanic: Quest
"Complete the quest, earn the reward!"
Meet the quest conditions to earn powerful quest rewards!

Mechanic: Infuse & Necrium
"The power has always been there; you just need to learn how to control it!"
Infuse cards gain additional special effects by sacrificing other cards.
Cards with Necrium will be played and exhausted one extra time.
